If i and j are positive integers, does (-i)/j always have the same value as -(i/j)? Justify your
answer.

	(-i)/j does not always have the same value as -(i/j). The behavior of / with negative operands
depends on which implementation of C. C89 will round the result either up, or down, potentially
differently each time, but the result will be signed correctly. In C99 the result will also be
signed correctly, but any decimal answer will be rounded closer to 0 instead of either up or down.
